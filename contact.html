        CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a powerful stylesheet language used to control the presentation and visual appearance of web pages.
        It was developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to separate the content of a web page (written in HTML or other markup languages) from its design elements, allowing developers to control layout, colors, fonts, and overall look and feel with greater flexibility and efficiency.
        By applying CSS, web designers can create visually appealing and consistent designs across multiple pages without the need to duplicate styling information.
        CSS works by selecting specific HTML elements and applying styles to them, using a combination of selectors, properties, and values.
        These selectors target elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more, while properties control aspects such as color, font size, spacing, alignment, borders, and backgrounds.
        CSS is designed to cascade, meaning styles are applied in a specific order of priority, allowing for complex designs to be managed with ease.
        There are three main ways to implement CSS: inline styles, which are written directly within an HTML tag using the style attribute; internal styles, which are placed inside the head section of an HTML document within a style tag; and external stylesheets, which are separate .css files linked to the HTML document using a link tag.
        External stylesheets are particularly useful for maintaining consistency across multiple web pages, as changes made to a single CSS file are automatically reflected wherever the file is linked.
        CSS also supports responsive design, enabling web pages to adjust smoothly across various screen sizes and devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
        This is achieved using flexible grid layouts, media queries, and fluid images, ensuring a seamless user experience regardless of device orientation or resolution.
        Furthermore, CSS offers advanced features like animations, transitions, and transformations, enabling developers to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces without relying on JavaScript.
        It also allows for the implementation of pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, which enable styling of elements in specific states, such as when a user hovers over a button or focuses on an input field.
        CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and Foundation have been developed to streamline the design process, offering pre-designed components and utilities that speed up development while ensuring modern, responsive designs.
        The flexibility of CSS has revolutionized web development, empowering designers to bring their creative visions to life while maintaining clean and organized code structures.
        As web technologies continue to evolve, CSS remains a foundational skill for frontend developers, providing the tools needed to build engaging, accessible, and visually stunning websites.
